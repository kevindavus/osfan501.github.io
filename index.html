          <h4>My self-summary</h4>

          <p>I'm a geek, a dad, and husband. I enjoy tinkering with computers and code and I enjoy customization. I thrive in
            having the freedom to make something truly reflect who I am.</p>

          <h4>What I’ve worked on</h4>

          <p>Developing programs for the Navy in partnerships with the FAA and Marines to help keep track of aircraft in flight
            to ensure they stay safe.</p>

          <p>I've also spent a lot of time building side projects on the front end to explore new technologies. Although I'm
            not currently in a position where I can work on this at my job, I spend as much time outside of work building
            projects to figure out how different frameworks and tools work.</p>

          <h4>Side Projects</h4>
          <p> Home automation software, starting in college for the Solar Decathlon with the Department of Energy and after graduating
            with my own house. I can't allow myself to have a typical boring house. I want the house to do the brunt of the
            work whether I'm there or not. I want lights to activate when I walk in or out of a room. I don't want movies
            to be missed because somebody decided to go to the kitchen for refreshments. I don't want to pay extra on utilities
            because somebody leaves the TV on at night. I don't want to dig around for my keys, so I have it unlock when
            I'm recognized.</p>

          <p> I'm currently working on a grocery store app that will allow the user to define recipes and encourages units and
            pictures to be used when adding items to a list to make the shopping experience as simple as possible Ideally
            it will use location to ping user when there are items in a list and they are near a grocery store. Still in
            the first steps of this project.</p>

          <h4>I’m really good at</h4>

          <p> Tinkering, tweaking, being a perfectionist.</p>

          <h4>What I’m looking to do next</h4>

          <p> mobile-first websites or mobile apps/progressive web apps. Continue building my experience as a front end developer
            and take on increasingly challenging tasks.</p>
